ADDITIONS:

* Updated folder removal for default temporary directory. Folder at `~/Downloads/yt-dlp-sc` is automatically created when a download passes VAL/RES test, and is removed after all files are moved to the final download directory.

* Updated ASCII art to reflect new version number.

FUTURE RELEASE PLANS:

* Add ability to parse multiple command options in one command.

* Show video title somewhere during downloading

* Create a more <b>responsive</b> UI. Not sure what that exactly means, but that'll get figured out.
