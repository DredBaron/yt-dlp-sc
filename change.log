ADDITIONS:

* Updated folder removal for default temporary directory. Folder at `~/Downloads/yt-dlp-sc` is automatically created when a download passes VAL/RES test, and is removed after all files are moved to the final download directory.

* Updated ASCII art to reflect new version number.

FUTURE RELEASE PLANS:

* Move the folder delete line for removing the folder `~/Downloads/yt-dlp-sc` somewhere deeper in the if/then to make sure it only creates/removes the folder when files are involved. It
    currently creates the folder and does not remove it, even if a video fails the URL VAL/RES test.

* Add ability to parse multiple command optins in one command.

* Show video title somewhere during downloading

* Create a more <b>responsive</b> UI. Not sure what that exactly means, but that'll get figured out.
